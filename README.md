A kidnapper wrote a ransom note but is worried it will be traced back to him. He found a magazine and wants to know if he can cut out whole words from it and use them to create an untraceable replica of his ransom note. The words in his note are case-sensitive and he must use whole words available in the magazine, meaning he cannot use substrings or concatenation to create the words he needs.

* Your quest is to write a program that takes two lines from the user:
  * The first line contains space-separated strings denoting the words present in the magazine. 
  * The second line contains  space-separated strings denoting the words present in the ransom note.
* Given the words in the magazine and the words in the ransom note, print "Yes" if he can replicate his ransom note _exactly_ using whole words from the magazine; otherwise, print "No".
